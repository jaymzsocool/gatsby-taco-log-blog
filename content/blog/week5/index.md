title: Week Five Review

Well here we are in week ~~five~~ *err...* Four 2: Electric Boogaloo. Here we're trying to attempt week four goals on UI/UX, but we know just don't know how far behind we are (forshadowing). So we start off the week just like we did every week before that. A grand battle plan drawn out, generals knowing exactly where to send their lines of code soldiers into the battlefield. There was much more chatter on the communications network than weeks prior, the generals were coordinating their attacks well, in the beginning at least. As dusk fell on the third day, and the reports of progress started to trickle in, there were some reports that never made it in. The next morning we would find that our taco log was still in disarray. So I took up arms, having already been successful in my campaign, and lead my lines of code into battle on a new frontier with just a few hours left before we report our progress to Field Marshal Joshua. Though I would not let all those lines of code die in vain. Alas though, it was not enough. The site was in tatters, the landing page was blocky yet functional, and the taco log left unfinished as I had ran out of time. The only shining bit was the profile page I completed but that was just not enough. We were court martialed for our lack of effort and sent back to HQ to recieve new assignments. The taco log was lost that day, but it will forever live on in my memories.
