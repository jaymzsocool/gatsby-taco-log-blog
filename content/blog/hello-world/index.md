Hello, this blog starts on Day 3 of the project. We've spent the first two days working on our Technical Design Document. Once we finished, we presented the TDD to Josh and Scott and we were met with great praise and enthusiasm. Our Front End is deployed on Netlify though at this point it's pretty basic and just displays "Hello World". Here on day three, we're working on getting the Back End deployed on Netlify, though I believe we might be changing to a deployment on Heroku.
