title: Week Four Review 
date: "2019-03-08"
---

Going into this week I had high hopes for the project. All throughout the previous weeks the rest of the team were talking about how they were good at styling, CSS and bootstrap/reactstrap. So I thought, excellent, I won't have to do any late night coding this week (and being my birthday, I would appreciate the break). Just standard work days this week. Unfortunately as the week got closer to the end it became clear that we were not going to finish on time. Unfortunately we scored a 1 and 2 out of 3 in UI and UX respectively. So this means it's going to be a busy weekend for coding! Well that's a basic summary of how things went this week. Here's some examples of what I worked on this week.
