title: Week One Review

This first week has been a new experience for me. When creating the TDD everything that was mentioned I agreed with so there wasn't that much to add. The feeling of not contributing lingered with a lack of direction, until I finally decided to just do something whether told to or not. So I started rooting around in the code and made the frontend and backend talk to each other by resolving a cors issue. Now the frontend pulls a message that's given by the endpoint on the backend. From now on I have the feeling that I'm just going to have to just code, even if someone is doing it or not. If I can do it faster or better then so be it. It seems the way to go if we can't agree on something for everyone to do. I know for certian the first thing I do will be to change the file structure before things start to get even messier!
