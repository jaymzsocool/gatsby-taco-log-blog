title: Week Three Review 
date: "2019-03-01"

This week I did not feel alone as much as I did the previous week but the feeling was still there. This week we had a lot to get done and we barely accomplised 80% of the required tasks. I feel like we could have sccomplished so much more however. It's just unfortunate that the seriousness of this project hasn't sunken in with everyone on the team. I can only hope that it will make sense next week. Our meeting with Josh went as I expected. He was pleased with what we had accomplished throughout the week but also disappointed that we didn't get everything into the project, namely the statistics graphs. That might be taken out of the scope of the project now. I think that we could work it into the project but we do need to move on, move forward. There's only two weeks left and we need to hit them hard. I'm going to leave this blog here with this week's notable accomplishements that I contributed to.
